# EDIT ME

1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Create a new local branch (you can use the -b flag to make new branches with the checkout command, like so: "git checkout -b my-new-branchname")
3. Push the unedited new local branch to the remote repo using "git push -u origin <insert-branch-name-here>" (the -u flag sets up tracking, so the new remote branch will be linked for pushes and pulls from your local branch)
4. Edit this file by adding a sentence for example
5. Stage this local change for committing and check of it was indeed added
6. Commit the staged change and check if it was indeed committed
7. Push the commit to the remote repo
8. Check out your branch and pushed code in the remote repo
9. Create a pull request in GitHub
